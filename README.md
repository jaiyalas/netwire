Netwire (clone)
=======

The [original Netwire](http://hub.darcs.net/ertes/netwire) is hosted on [darcs hub](http://hub.darcs.net/). 

Unfortunatly, it a bit out-dated (the last change, TAG v5.0.1, was made on December 30, 2014) and is not compactable with current haskell/hackages. Therefore I folk and host a clone of the original netwire here and hoping it will still work (maybe with some .cabal file fixing).
